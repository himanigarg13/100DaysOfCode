Using Regex, we can easily match or search for patterns in a text. Before searching for a pattern, we have to specify one using some well-defined syntax.

You have to check whether the syntax of the given pattern is valid.


Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer N, denoting the number of test cases. The next N lines contain a string of any printable characters representing the pattern of a regex.


Output Format

For each test case, print Valid if the syntax of the given pattern is correct. Otherwise, print Invalid. Do not print the quotes.

It is widely used to define the constraint on strings such as password and email validation. After learning Java regex tutorial, you will be able to test your regular expressions by the Java Regex Tester Tool.
