You are given an integer n , we have to convert it into a string.

If your code successfully converts n into a string  the code will print "Good job". Otherwise it will print "Wrong answer".


n can range between - 100 to 100 inclusive.

Using toString Method of Integer Class

The Integer class has a static method that returns a String object representing the specified int parameter. 

The argument is converted and returned as a string instance. If the number is negative, the sign will be preserved. 

Logic :

In this program, we simply used a simple function ( Integer.toString(n)) to convert int to String type and then it prints good job.


Sample Input 0:

100
 
Sample Output 0: 

Good job
