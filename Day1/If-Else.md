Question:

Given an integer n,  perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird

If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird

If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird

If n is even and greater than 20 , print Not Weird


Logic :

1. Firstly, we create java IfElse1 class and initialize the main class.

2. Import java packages and create an object for input from user by using Scanner class.

3. Store user input value in variable 'a' of integer type.

3. Now, build a logic for 'Weird' and 'Not Weird'.

4. If 'a' is 'not equal to' 2 or 'equals to ' and range between 6 <= a <= 20 then print "Weird".

5. If 'a' is 'equals to' to 2 and range between 2 <= a <= 5 or a>= 20 then print "Not Weird".
