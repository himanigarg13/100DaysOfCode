These numbers are so big that you can't contain them in any ordinary data types like a long integer.

Use the power of Java's BigInteger class and solve this problem.



Input Format:

There will be two lines containing two numbers,a and b.



Constraints:

a and b are non-negative integers and can have maximum 200 digits.



Output Format:

Output two lines. The first line should contain a+b, and the second line should contain a*b. Don't print any leading zeros.



Logic:

Big Integer class extends Number and implements Comparable interface. It provides analogues to all of Java's primitive integer operators and all methods from java.lang.Math package.BigInteger class is used for the mathematical operation which involves very big integer calculations that are outside the limit of all available primitive data types.
