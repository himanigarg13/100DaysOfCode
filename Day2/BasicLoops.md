In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.
Looping in programming languages is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true. Java provides three ways for executing the loops. While all the ways provide similar basic functionality, they differ in their syntax and condition checking time.

Task:
Given an integer,N, print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple N * i (where 1 <= i <= 10) should be printed on a new line in the form: N x i = result.

Input Format:
A single integer,N.

Constraints:
2 <= N <= 20

Output Format:
Print 10 lines of output; each line i (where 1 <= i <= 10) contains the results of N * i in the form:
N x i = result.

Logic:

1. First we create the main class of name BasicLoops.

2. Now it takes input value from user to print the table.

3. Now we use for loop to print the table.

4. Logic of table : N = user input, i = how many times loops run , and create an integer value result for result = N * i.

5. Then print the value in form of table : N + "x" + i + "=" result.

Sample Input:
2

Sample Output:

2 x 1 = 2

2 x 2 = 4

2 x 3 = 6

2 x 4 = 8

2 x 5 = 10

2 x 6 = 12

2 x 7 = 14

2 x 8 = 16

2 x 9 = 18

2 x 10 = 20
